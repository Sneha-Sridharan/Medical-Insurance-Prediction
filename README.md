# Medical Insurance Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks
- The main objective of the proposed project is to predict the medical insurance amount that a person pays.
- Based on the factors  such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, whether a person is a smoker or not and region, the appropriate insurance amount that the customer has to pay is predicted.
- Medical expenses are difficult to estimate because the most costly conditions are rare and random. So, by using the data sets, the insurance companies estimate the average medical care expenses for  a population segment. 
For example, a smoker is more likely to get lung cancer and a person with higher BMI is more prone to heart diseases. Based on the medical risk associated with the person, the insurance charge is predicted.
- ANN is used to solve this problem
